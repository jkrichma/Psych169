Repository contains projects from my Spring 2017 Android for Cognitive Sciences course.

ABR_AutoRover - Controls the Android Based Rover5 Robot. Reads the IRs. Start/Stop button allows the robot to move forward or stop. Good starting point for programming ABRs.

ABR_Peeper - Created by Carina Kaltenbach. Streams live video to the IP address shown on the phone. Hitting the START button will cause the robot to roam. IRs are used for obstacle avoidance.

color-blob-detection - Shows how to use openCV and the Android camera. 

Cookies - Shows how to use imageview, textview, and button in an Android app.

HellioIOIO - Shows how to connect Android App to IOIO-OTG interface board.

IOIOSimpleApp - Reads from an IR sensor on the IOIO analog input, and sends PWM signals through the IOIO to a servo.

JustJava - Shows how to create a user interface with many buttons, bells and whistles. Created from the Udacity course: Android Development for Beginners

OpenCvTest - Shows how to set up OpenCV libraries in an Android app.

QRover - Created by Brandon Turk. Controls Rover5 ABR while reading QR codes. If the robot sees a QR code for START, it will roam autonomously and use the IRs to avoid obstacles. If the robot sees a QR code for STOP, it will stop moving.

RoboPup - Created by Farah Arabi.  Controls Rover5 ABR and takes voice commands for starting, staying, turning, etc.
